Hi! I am Haoran <b>Liang<b> (<b>梁<b> 浩然), a PhD student at King’s College London under the supervision of [Payman Kassaei](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=37022) and [Fred Diamond](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=49401). Previously, I obtained my Master’s degree at ETH Zürich and Bachelor‘s degree at Xi’an Jiaotong University. 

I am a big fan of number theory with broad interests in its intersecting areas. Currently, I find the following topics very appealing

(p-adic) automorphic forms;

rational points on varieties;

Iwasawa theory, in particular p-adic L-functions;

cohomological topics in number theory.

Outside mathematics, I enjoy reading, playing badminton, and music, etc. You will surely find me at various kinds of museums. Before the triumph of AI, I loved playing Go very much (I am trying to understand the art of Go after AI).
