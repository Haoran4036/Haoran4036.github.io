Hi! welcome to Haoran <b> Liang</b>'s (<b> 梁 </b> 浩然) home page. This website trys to record some beautiful scenery along his journey in mathematics, literature, and art.

He is now a PhD student at King’s College London under the supervision of [Payman Kassaei](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=37022) and [Fred Diamond](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=49401). Previously, he obtained Master’s degree at ETH Zürich and Bachelor‘s degree at Xi’an Jiaotong University. 

He is a big fan of number theory with broad interests in its intersecting areas. Currently, the following topics very appealing to him

(p-adic) automorphic forms;

rational points on varieties;

Iwasawa theory, in particular p-adic L-functions;

cohomological topics in number theory.

When not studying mathematics, he can usually be found reading, playing badminton, or wandering various exhibits at museums with a good audioguide. Before the triumph of AI, he loved playing Go very much (he is now struggling to appreciate the art of Go in the post-AI era).
