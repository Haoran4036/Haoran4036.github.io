<p>Hi! welcome to Haoran <b> Liang’s </b> (<b> 梁 </b> 浩然) homepage. He is now a PhD student at King’s College London under the supervision of <a href="https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=37022" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Payman Kassaei</a> and <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=49401" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Fred Diamond</a>. Previously, he obtained Master’s degree at ETH Zürich and Bachelor‘s degree at Xi’an Jiaotong University.</p>

<p>He is a big fan of number theory with broad interests in its intersecting areas. Currently, the following topics very appealing to him</p>

<p>(p-adic) automorphic forms;</p>

<p>rational points on varieties;</p>

<p>Iwasawa theory, in particular p-adic L-functions;</p>

<p>cohomological topics in number theory.</p>

<p>When not studying mathematics, he can usually be found reading, playing badminton, or wandering various exhibits at museums with a good audioguide. Before the triumph of AI, he loved playing Go very much (he is now struggling to appreciate the art of Go in the post-AI era).</p>
